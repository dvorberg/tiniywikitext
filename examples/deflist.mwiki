An example of a definition list:

; Term
: Definition of that term.

; Word
: Well, not every word is a “term”. Some are other stuff. 

What follows is a definition list without empty lines between term/def pairs:

; Term 1
: Def 1
; Term 2
: Def 2

This is legal.

; Term 3
: Def 3
And some arbitrary text.
